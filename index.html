### Today's Topics

<div class="simple-box">

* Why did the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse?
  * The bridge collapsed on November 7, 1940
* Equations of motion for harmonic and damped oscillations
  * A simple pendulum model
* Bernoulli's theorem and lift, negative lift
* Vibration equation with negative damping due to lift
* Mechanism of **self-excited vibration**
  * A small difference in the equation of motion can drastically change the result!

### The Collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge

<div class="simple-box">

* Collapsed on November 7, 1940
* The bridge undulated significantly due to wind!
* Let's watch the actual video!

</div>

### The Current Tacoma Narrows Bridge

<div class="simple-box">

* Rebuilt in 1950
* A second bridge was constructed in 2007

</div>

### Important Notes

<div class="simple-box">

* The actual cause of the bridge collapse is more complex
  * Wind tunnel tests and numerical simulations are used in bridge design
* But today we'll consider the simplest model
* We'll focus on the mechanism of **self-excited vibration**!

</div>

## Equations of Motion for Vibration

---

### Pendulum Motion

<div class="simple-box">

* Lift the pendulum and release it
* A restoring force acts to move it toward the center due to gravity
* Swings to the opposite end
* This repetition causes the pendulum to oscillate

</div>

<img src="assets/images/harmonic-oscillator-pendulum.svg" height="400px">

---

### Equation of Motion for Harmonic Oscillation

$$ m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \underbrace{kx}_{\text{restoring force}} = 0 $$

$$ x(t) = A \cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t + \varphi \right) $$

<div class="highlight-box">

* This motion is called **harmonic oscillation**

</div>

---

### Equation of Motion for Damped Oscillation

<div class="simple-box">

* A real pendulum doesn't continue oscillating forever
* The oscillation gradually decreases due to damping forces like air resistance and friction

</div>

$$ m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \underbrace{\beta \frac{dx}{dt}}_{\text{damping force}} + kx  = 0 $$

---

### Damped Oscillation

<img src="assets/images/damping-vibration.png" height="250px">

$$ x(t) = A \exp(-\beta t) \cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t + \varphi \right) $$

<div class="highlight-box">

* The oscillation gradually decreases!

</div>

---

## Lift and Negative Lift

---

### Fluid Motion

<div class="simple-box">

* Air and water are examples of "flowing substances" called fluids
* Forces exerted on objects by wind or water flow can be understood through fluid motion

</div>

<img src="assets/images/fluid-flow.png" height="300px">

---

### Bernoulli's Theorem

<div class="simple-box">

* A theorem that describes the relationship between fluid velocity and pressure
  * When fluid velocity increases, pressure decreases
  * When fluid velocity decreases, pressure increases
* Since air is light, we'll ignore potential energy today

</div>

$$ p + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \cancel{\rho gh} = \text{const} $$

---

### Lift

<div class="simple-box">

* Fluid velocity increases on the upper side of the plate, pressure decreases
* Fluid velocity decreases on the lower side of the plate, pressure increases
* The pressure difference creates an upward force on the plate (**lift**)

</div>

<img src="assets/images/lift.svg" height="600px">

---

### Negative Lift

<div class="simple-box">

* Fluid velocity decreases on the upper side of the plate, pressure increases
* Fluid velocity increases on the lower side of the plate, pressure decreases
* The pressure difference creates a downward force on the plate (**negative lift**)

</div>

<img src="assets/images/negative-lift.svg" height="600px">

---

### Applications of Lift and Negative Lift

<div class="simple-box">

* Lift creates an upward force that allows an airplane to fly
* Negative lift creates a downward force that keeps an F1 car pressed against the track

## Self-Excited Vibration

---

### Self-Excited Vibration

<div class="simple-box">

* The pendulum is subjected to lift due to wind
* The lift creates a vibration that amplifies the motion! (**self-excited vibration**)

</div>

<img src="assets/images/self-excited-pendulum.svg" height="600px">

---

### Familiar Example

<div class="simple-box">

* If you swing the swing with the vibration, the vibration becomes larger!
* The same thing happens with lift!

</div>

<img src="assets/images/swing.png" height="400px">

---

### Equation of Motion for Self-Excited Vibration

$$ m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} \underbrace{ - \beta \frac{dx}{dt}}_{\text{opposite sign!}} + kx  = 0 $$

<div class="simple-box">

* Vibration with negative damping
* Just a change in sign...
  * What happens?

</div>

---

### General Solution

<img src="assets/images/self-excited-vibration.png" height="250px">

$$ x(t) = A \exp(\beta t) \cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t + \varphi \right) $$

<div class="highlight-box">

* Vibration becomes larger!

</div>

---

### Why Did the Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse?

<div class="simple-box">

* Self-excited vibration mechanism worked!
* The bridge undulated significantly due to wind!

</div>

### Conclusion

<div class="simple-box">

* Equations of motion for harmonic oscillation can represent the motion of a pendulum!
* Equations of motion for damped oscillation can represent the motion of a pendulum that gradually decreases in amplitude!
* Forces due to fluid flow and plate tilt create upward lift or downward negative lift!
* Equations of motion for vibration with negative damping can represent the mechanism of self-excited vibration!

</div>

### One Sign Changes the World!

$$ m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \beta \frac{dx}{dt} + kx  = 0 $$

$$ m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - \beta \frac{dx}{dt} + kx  = 0 $$

### Additional Notes

<div class="simple-box">

* The actual fluid dynamics of bridge structures is more complex
  * It is believed that the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed due to aeroelastic flutter
* Torsional vibration is also a significant cause
* **Self-excited vibration alone is not the cause!**
* But today we focused on the simplest self-excited vibration!
